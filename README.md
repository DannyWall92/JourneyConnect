# JourneyConnect
This is a VERY basic "dating app" to connect people based on personal development experts they like, however it is in VERY early stages of development and still needs A LOT of functionality added.

Just as importantly there are missing "cyber security" items with the code that also need to be added to prevent SQL injection, XSLT, and other attacks.

Further, the SQL file to create the database is not included, if you would like it, please just send an email to danny@dewdevelopment.com and I'll send it to you.

Installation is quite easy:
1) Create the database and tables needed (again, you can get the SQL from me)
2) Modify the config.php file to contain your details
3) Then upload all files to your server webroot.

If you have any questions feel free to send me an email.
